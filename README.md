# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

My Name is **Maria Rose Mulhall**.

I am a student at **Southern Alberta Institute of Technology** (SAIT), where I am pursuing an **Interactive Design Diploma** (IDD) with a major in **User Experience** (UX)!

Outside of an interest in interactive design, I have an interest in photography.

I am excited about the interactive design community's future and my involvement in it, and I am eager to develop my skills further through collaboration with others!
